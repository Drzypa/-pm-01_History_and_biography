\begin{document}
\emph{Andr\'e Bloch} (1893 - 1948) French mathematician perhaps best known for Bloch's theorem on holomorphic disks (not to be confused with Felix Bloch's theorem on eigenfunctions of periodic particle wavefunctions).

In 1914, Andr\'e Bloch briefly served in the French Army during World War I. Three years later, Bloch killed three relatives and was confined to a mental institution. From there he collaborated by mail with important mathematicians such as Jacques Hadamard and George P\'olya. In 1948, Bloch was awarded the Becquerel Prize.
