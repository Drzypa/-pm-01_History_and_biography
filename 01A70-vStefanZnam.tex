\begin{document}
Slovak mathematician and mathematics professor, (February 9, 1936 - July 17, 1993), posed Zn\'am's problem.

His ErdÅ‘s number is 2 by at least six different paths. For example, in 1968, ZnÃ¡m wrote a paper on "Strongly geodetic graphs" with Juraj BosÃ¡k in the {\it Journal of Combinatorial Theory}. Three years later, BosÃ¡k co-authored "Decompositions of complete graphs into factors with diameter two" with ErdÅ‘s and Alexander Rosa in {\it Mathematics Casopis Slovene Akademie Vied}.
