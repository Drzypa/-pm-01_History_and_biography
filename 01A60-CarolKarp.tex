\emph{Carol Karp} n\'ee \emph{Carol Ruth Vander Velde} (1926 - 1972) American mathematician of Dutch ancestry. Best known for her work on infinitary logic, she also played viola in an all-women orchestra.

Born in Michigan to a farming supply store manager and a housewife, Carol and her siblings graduated from high school in Ohio. After that, she graduated from Manchester College and went back to Michigan to study at Michigan~State~University (then called Michigan State College). In 1951 she married Arthur Karp and took his last name. Carol Karp earned a \PMlinkescapetext{Ph}.D. in California while teaching in New Mexico. At the University of Maryland she helped enlarge the mathematical logic department in professors and graduate students, and obtained a National Science Foundation grant for undergraduate research. In 1969 she was diagnosed with breast cancer but remained active until her death three years later.
