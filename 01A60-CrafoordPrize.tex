\begin{document}
A prize awarded every year to one or two (sometimes three), scientists in certain fields not covered by the Nobel Prize (specifically, mathematics, biology and astronomy) at a congress of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. The cash value of the award in 2006 was $US\$500,000$.

Holger Crafoord, the inventor of the artificial kidney, founded the award in his testament. The first recipients received the award in 1982. Since then the award has been periodic.
