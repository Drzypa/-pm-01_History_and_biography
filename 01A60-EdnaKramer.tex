\emph{Edna Ernestine Kramer Lassar} (1902 - 1984) American mathematician, educator, author and biographer.

Born in New York City of Jewish immigrants from Europe, young Edna was named after an uncle whose gift for mathematics was unrealized due to early death. After graduating from high school, she went to Hunter College, earning a bachelor's \PMlinkescapetext{degree} summa cum laude in mathematics and went on to graduate work at Columbia, minoring in physics. She preferred teaching mathematics in high school rather than college, but \PMlinkescapetext{eventually} did teach college. At Abraham Lincoln High in New York she met Benedict Lassar, a French teacher. They married. During World War II, Edna Kramer did a lot of work in statistics. She died of pneumonia in Manhattan.
