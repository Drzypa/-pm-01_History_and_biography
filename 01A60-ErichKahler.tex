\begin{document}
\emph{Erich K\"ahler} (1906 - 2000) German geometer and philosopher, after whom the K\"ahler manifold is named.

K\"ahler studied at the University of Leipzig, where he worked on celestial mechanics and what would later become scheme theory. After earning his Ph.D., he taught in his hometown and in Berlin and Hamburg. Building on \'Elie Cartan's work on differential geometry, K\"ahler made advances in algebraic geometry.
