<div id="p24" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Scribal unit fraction answers contained two sides, additive numerators, and LCM scaled reminders. Math historians, beginning with F. Hultsch in 1895, parsed aspects of the scribal aliquot part views of numerators and LCM denominators, though the unified aspects of the system remained vague for another 105 years. In 2002, the EMLR was validated containing aliquot parts of LCM denominators in none optimized manners. The LCM (m/m) was written as a unity becoming a multiplier that scribes used to scale rational numbers to optimized, but not optimal, unit fraction series in 2/n table tables and every day problem and answers. In 2006 the Akhmim Wooden Tablet was validated containing exact quotient and remainders within its primary division division method, ancient fragments documented in the EMLR and RMP 2/n table. The EMLR and RMP 2/n table were fully decoded in <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">http://www.academia.edu/617613/Egyptian_Fractions_Unit_Fractions_Hekats_and_Wages_-_an_Update</span>2011 as reported in Appendix I and II.</p>

<div id="p25" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">During the Old Kingdom hieroglyphic writing scribes threw away 1/64 units within a 6-term binary notation named Horus-Eye. Around 1950 BCE the Akhmim Wooden Tablet (AWT) reported a hekat unity system solving the Old Kingdom round-off problem. Corrected volume units added back missing 1/64 units. Within the corrected notation multiplication of 400-hekat, 100-hekat, 4-hekat and 1-hekat substituted two classes of hekat units, one hekat = (64/64) (defined in the AWT and RMP 47) calculated binary quotients (Q/64) and scaled Egyptian fraction remainders (5R/n)ro; and one hekat = 320 ro (in RMP 35-38).</p>

<p class="ltx_p">Concerning hekat arithmetic details, the <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">http://akhmimwoodentablet.blogspot.com</span>AWT discuss the hekat unity. The unity was partitioned by rational numbers. Multiplication and division answers recorded binary quotients and scaled (5R/n)ro Egyptian fraction remainders, hekat units as 1/10 (hinu), 1/64 (dja), 1/320 (ro), and other units within modified quotients and remainders. The secondary hekat system converted m/n to integer quotients and non-scaled Egyptian fraction remainders written as m/n ”name”. For example, Ahmes created 1/10 units writing m = 10 and n= 3 by using the expression 10/3 hin, meaning (3 + 1/3)hin.</p>
</div>
<div id="p27" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The AWT’s binary quotient and Egyptian fraction partitions were proven by multiplying each quotient and remainder answer by the initial divisor. The exact proof calculation returned each quotient and scaled remainder answer to an initial (64/64) unity value. The AWT proof may be the first proof recorded in Western math history. Ahmes applied the proof methid in RMP 35-38, 320 ro problems.</p>

<div id="p29" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The Reisner Papyrus(RP), circa 1800 BCE, defines a labor efficiency division by 10 quotient and unscaled remainder rate. The RMP’s first six problems used the RP division by 10 method. The RMP is one of several texts that confirm the scribal use of a second form of quotient and remainder arithmetic. Modern historians, going beyond 1920’s additive transliteration limitations, by considering meta Egyptian fractions, agree with the RP method, and other forms of meta (unified) Egyptian fraction mathematics.</p>

The <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">http://rmprectotable.blogspot.com</span>RMP 2/n table was written by Ahmes in 1650 BCE. Translators assumed that Ahmes had intuitively used ’red auxiliary’ multiples to write optimized, but not optimal, unit fraction series. When the RMP was first published in 1879, historians began the task of breaking the 2/n table code, a project that was not completed until 2005. The earliest nearly successful code breaking effort was published by F. Hultsch in 1895. With E.M. Bruins confirming Hultsch’s aliquot part approach in 1944. Today F. Hultsch and E.M. Bruins are honored by the Hultsch-Bruins method.</p>

<div id="p33" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Returning to the 1650 BCE and the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus it began with a 2/n table. A 200 year older text, the Egyptian Mathematical Leather Roll (EMLR) was a student’s introduction to the 2/n table subject. A student converted 26 rational numbers to non-optimal Egyptian fraction series. The EMLR converted rational numbers such as 1/8 by using multiples 3/3, 5/5 and 25/25.

<div id="p34" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Several Egyptian unit fraction notations were continuously used from 2050 BCE to 1637 AD. For about 3,700 years Egyptian fraction methods unitized rational numbers in nearby Mediterranean cultures. Greeks used the hieratic numeration systems by mapping the counting numbers onto Ionian and Dorian alphabets. Unit fractions were denoted by a Greek letter followed by ’, or beta’ = 1/2. Greeks, and Hellenes fully used the Egyptian fraction method of converting rational numbers to Egyptian fraction series for several purposes altering Ahmes’ methods in minor ways.</p>

<div id="p40" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Around 800 AD a major change took place in the Mediterranean region. Modern base 10 numerals diffused from India and Arab trade began to enter Europe. By 999 AD, a Catholic Pope adopted Arab mathematics with its base 10 numerals and Egyptian fraction arithmetic. By the time of Leonardo de Pisa, Fibonacci, and the 1202 AD Liber Abaci, European weights an measures were also written in Arabic numerals.</p>
</div>
<div id="p41" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In 1585 AD, the beginning of our modern base 10 decimals, modern base 10 decimals literally erased 3,600 years of Egyptian fraction arithmetic history. By 1900 AD European and Arab scholars were unable to read medieval Egyptian fractions texts as well as the older Egyptian mathematical texts.</p>
</div>
<div id="p42" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Ahmes’ 84 problems have been slowly read by scholars after the RMP was published in 1877. The 2/n table was key to scholar research. But what method or methods did Ahmes use to create his 2/n table? Ahmes seemingly left few clues to assist scholars in decoding the 2/n table’s construction method(s). Post-1877 scholars relied on intuition and personalized mathematical senses to report suspected details, often confusing the subject. Scholarly debates have correctly focused on the 2/n table and its construction methods. Yet, confirmed 2/n table threads continue to be controversial. Egyptologists, and math historians, i.e. Neugebauer, Exact Sciences in Antiquity, had inappropriately proposed that the RMP 2/n table and related Egyptian fraction methods represented forms of intellectual decline.</p>
</div>
<div id="p43" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">However, one simple RMP 2/n table construction method, multiples, was reported in 2002 that changed the debate. An advanced idea had created finite unit fraction statements. By 2006 it was shown that Egyptian fraction statements had solved an Old Kingdom infinite series round-off problem. Scholars continue to parse several theoretical fragments of a group of ancient texts by considering related arithmetic patterns. As a consequence 130 years of confusion related to Egyptian fraction arithmetic is lifting an intellectual fog.</p>
</div>
<div id="p44" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">For example, Ahmes, the RMP scribe, has gained the majority of scholarly attention since the RMP was published in 1877. Sylvester in 1891 incorrectly suggested that the greedy algorithm was present in the medieval Liber Abaci and by implication the RMP. Hultsch in 1895 began to parse Ahmes’ 2/p conversion patterns by using aliquot parts. It took Bruins in 1944 to confirm Hultsch’s earlier work, now known as the H-B method.</p>
</div>
<div id="p45" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Ahmes, therefore, converted 2/p rational numbers into optimal or elegant Egyptian fraction series using a form of the H-B method. Ahmes’ shorthand indicated that 2/43, and other 2/n table members, were converted to an Egyptian fraction series by selecting optimal multiples, in the 2/43 case the multiple 42. Ahmes use of the multiple 42 allowed 1/42 to become the first partition. The remaining Egyptian fraction were found by considering the divisors (aliquot parts) of 42 or (21, 14, 7, 6, 3, 2, 1). Ahmes’ fragmented shorthand indicates:</p>
</div>
<div id="p46" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">2/43*42/42 = (42 + 21 + 14 + 6)/(42*43),</p>
</div>
<div id="p47" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">such that:</p>
</div>
<div id="p48" class="ltx_para">

<p class="ltx_p">Today, 20th century additive scholarly adherents oddly do not accept the H-B method, or related methods used by Egyptians, Greeks, Hellenes, Arabs, medievals and others for over 3,000 years. It is clear that H-B type methods used modern addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations and correctly parse 3,700 years of rational numbers conversions to Egyptian fraction series. <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_Razor</span>Occam’s Razor , the simplest method is likely the historical method, is slowly changing scholarly minds.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">As another long term verification of Ahmes’ arithmetic Fibonacci’s 1202 AD <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">http://liberabaci.blogspot.com</span>Liber Abaci reports a very old style of writing multiples within the first four of seven rational number conversion methods.</p>
</div>
<div id="p52" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Summary: Today, interdisciplinary studies groups are oddly created by ’invitation only’. As meta aspects of ancient mathematics are randomly studied, without invitation, based on reading entire bodies of mathematical texts, great academic progress in understanding ancient mathematics will take place. Currently, common abstract mathematics themes are deposited in fragmented story lines, often transliterating a small set of the ancient records, not noticing closely related mathematical methods. Moreover, university math history and philology departments often do not professionally share common meta themes (found by parsing numerical data) even when their offices are in the same building.</p>
</div>
<div id="p53" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Broadly considering Old Kingdom edicts several Pharaohs likely had requested exact numerical systems to control and allocate vital inventories of grain and its products including beer and bread are often mentioned. Egyptian scribes exactly converted rational numbers to optimal or elegant unit fraction series. The Middle Kingdom innovation exactly scaled weights and measure units to two Egyptian fraction systems, one defined in the Reisner Papyrus and the second in the Akhmim Wooden Tablet.</p>
</div>
<div id="p54" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Since 2002 AD scholarly debates are increasingly correcting Middle Kingdom shorthand omissions of Egyptian fraction mathematics by adding back the missing data in scribal longhand notations. The 2050 BCE point of departure date formalized Egyptian fraction innovations within abstract arithmetic and practical weights and measures notations. Greeks and Arab scribes modified the theoretical arithmetic and weights and measures notations. Medieval scribes by Fibonacci recorded Greek and Arab versions of the oldest Egyptian fraction mathematics. For example, Sigler’s 2002 translation of the 1202AD Liber Abaci includes four 1650 BCE conversion methods. Fibonacci’s era used 3,000 year old Egyptian fraction conversion methods that modified an ancient multiplication context to a medieval subtraction context. Today, 20th century Egyptian fraction debates, that fragments analyzed mathematical theory and practical statements are being unified. The oldest Egyptian fraction mathematics are being connected to the medieval era in interesting ways. The largest set of ancient texts that describe economic and weights and measures texts are linked to the 1950 BCE hieratic texts and to the 1202 AD Liber Abaci. Over 3150 years of common uses of rational number and unit fraction monetary methods.</p>
