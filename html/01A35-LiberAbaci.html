<p class="ltx_p">Abstract (2015 Update):
The âLiber Abaciâ, a 1202 AD Latin text, primarily scaled vulgar fractions n/p to unit fraction by seven distinctions in a subtraction context. The Hindu-Arabic numeral notation began in 800 AD scaled rational numbers n/p by LCM m per: (n/p - 1/m) = (mn -p)/mp, replaced Greek alphabet ciphered rational numbers encoded by multiplication. Fibonacci set numerator (mn -p) to unity (1) as often as possible to define 2-term series. In the seventh distinction 3-term series were calculated by subtracting a second 1/m. The first of three Arab arithmetic notations solved arithmetic, algebra, geometry and modular arithmetic problems, such as an inverse proportion square root method used by Archimedes, pertinent to the medieval era.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">INTRODUCTION
The âLiber Abaciâ (Book of Calculation) was written by Leonardo Pisano. Fibonacci was Leonardo’s Latin name. Leonard was the son of a Pisa merchant, and often went with his father to Arab ports and other trading locations. On these trips Leonardo wrote down practical and abstract sides Hindu-Arabic arithmetic operations that were used in the regional weights and measures system of the Mediterranean world. As a historical consequence, Fibonacci documentation of medieval trading units indirectly and directly reported aspects s of very old theoretical and practical Egyptian fraction arithmetic that were passed down to medieval traders.</p>
</div>
<div id="p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The âLiber Abaciâ was a very successful book. It was used in the medieval period for 250 years to teach arithmetic and higher mathematics in European Latin schools. Today, five copies of the book exist. The 800 year old book had been partially translated by 20th century scholars. Scholars tended to take single arithmetic subjects, often omitted related arithmetic subjects linked to older unit fraction arithmetic.
</p>
</div>
<div id="p4" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Modern base 10 decimal themes were built by an algorithm flowered after 1585 CE. The foundations of our decimal system retained 3,200 year older finite Egyptian fraction arithmetic, but implicitly hid the older finite number theory, arithmetic, and algebraic foundations that stressed algorithms as questions. Singular 20th century themes oddly limited âLiber Abaciâ translations to base 10 decimals foundations related to algorithms. For example, theory of equation and number theory algorithm focused books drew upon medieval algebra but omitted large aspects of medieval number theory.</p>
</div>
<div id="p5" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Siglerâs 2002 translation is 500 pages. The first 125 pages began to expose medieval arithmetic and hints of pertinent aspects of the 3,200 year older Egyptian fraction arithmetic. Earlier scholars footnoted and discussed âLiber Abaci âmath topics without decoding arithmetic and algebra building blocks taken from older arithmetic foundations. The Sigler translation was a great improvement over the earlier partial translations.</p>
</div>
<div id="p6" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">But even Sigler failed to expose final rational number notations that scaled n/p by subtracting LCM 1/m, i.e. (n/p â 1/m) = (mn-p). Earlier Greek rational numbers were also not cited by Sigler that scaled n/p by multiplying LCM m/m, i.e. (n/p)(m/m) = (mn/mp). Greeks also used scaled rational numbers in its final notation, as Egyptians did before them, by finding the best divisors of mp summed to mn. Arabs had replaced Ionian and Dorian alphabet encoding of numerals that mapped 1/2 = betaâ, and so forth.</p>
</div>
<div id="p7" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Sigler’s important work footnoted most arithmetic, algebra and higher math topics, recorded in final rational number notations and methods. Sigler made sense of Leonardoâs rambling narratives by overlaying modern versions of medieval unit fraction arithmetic. Sigler’s footnotes are important, yet sparse based on his untimely death and confusing modern points of view.</p>
</div>
<div id="p8" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The Sigler translation directly and indirectly includes the fundamental theorem of arithmetic as understood by Arabs. The first seven chapters indirectly discuss theoretical and practical aspects of the 3,200-year old system of Egyptian fractions. At various places Leonardo cites three different arithmetic notations to record rational numbers in unit fraction series. The first arithmetic notation was dominant in the 500 page book. The second and third notations were used for special factoring purposes not intended to be parsed by this paper.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">LEONARDO’S SEVEN EGYPTIAN FRACTION METHODS (Distinctions)
This paper analyzes seven rational number conversion methods, or distinctions, as written in âLiber Abaciâ remainder arithmetic. Leonardo used the first notation to scale vulgar fractions to elegant and not-so-elegant Egyptian fractions series. Fibonacci indirectly discusses older Egyptian fraction system as this paper will hi-light.</p>
</div>
<div id="p10" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The seven conversion methods used by Leonardo were built by selecting a subtraction 1/m, a LCM, in a subtraction a step, per âab initioâ, from the beginning details:</p>
</div>
<div id="p11" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">(n/p - 1/m) = (mn - p)/mp</p>
</div>
<div id="p12" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Fibonacci set (mn âp) = 1 as often as possible, in the first six distinctions, further discussed by:</p>
</div>
<div id="p13" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">1. Leonardoâs first distinction</p>
</div>
<div id="p14" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The first method contains three aspectsâthe simple, the composite, and a reversed composite. Two remainder arithmetic notations were used.</p>
</div>
<div id="p15" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">a. Simple factoring, 1/2 of 1/9 meant 1/18. In addition 1/2 x1/9 was converted to an Egyptian fraction series 1/2 = 1/3 + 1/6. Note that 1/18 = 1/27 + 1/54, was an older Egyptian fraction series that Fibonacci did not list.
</p>
</div>
<div id="p16" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">b. The second composite used a Greek or Arab notation that reported 1/18 = 1/2 0/9, which equals 5/10 0/9, as listed by Leonardo. Aspects of this rule may date to the time of Ahmes, when (64/64), a hekat unity was partitioned into 1/64 quotients 1/320 (ro) remainders. In other examples Ahmes mentally scaled 1/2 to 5/10, a common practice employed by Ahmes (who scaled 1/64 by 5/5 to 5/320, recorded as 5 ro)</p>
</div>
<div id="p17" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">c. The third reversed composite used a Greek or Arab notation that allowed the denominators, 10 and 9, to be switched, stating that:</p>
</div>
<div id="p18" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">1/18 = 5/10 0/9 = 5/9 0/10.</p>
</div>
<div id="p19" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Note that 5/10 0/9 = 5/90 = 1/18 and 5/9 0/10 = 5/90 = 1/18.</p>
</div>
<div id="p20" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Sigler summarized Leonardo’s first method (distinction) rule, and its three aspects, primarily through the assistance of Dunton and Grimm’s ”Fibonacci on Egyptian fraction” paper. Dunton and Grimm stressed the algebraic statement k/kl = 1/l, an algebraic identity, as a fair method (which it is not) to capture Leonardoâs three part rule. Note that the third aspect of Leonardo’s method (distinction), titled ”third reversed composite,” is one of three methods that Dunton and Grimm did not parse, a logical omission that Sigler adopted.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">CONCLUSiONS:</p>
</div>
<div id="p85" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">1. The âLiber Abaciâ demonstrated uses of vulgar fractions in square root intermediate steps, and in other problems, including the scaling of final rational number answers usually with no hint of an algorithm. Use of vulgar fractions in mental and written arithmetic was common.
2. The formal medieval rational number system was rigorously demonstrated in the first 1/3 of the âLiber Abaciâ, but unequally applied in the remaining 2/3 of the book. For example, the square root of 10 mentioned as (3 + 1/6 â 1/228)^2 was not recorded in a final rational number notation.
3. Distinction one contained three older arithmetic methods that may date to an Egyptian scribal style of writing parts of a fraction. Egyptian scribal long hand decoded from the EMLR and RMP scaled rational numbers by LCM m/n in a multiplication context. Leonardo scaled 1/18 by factoring 1/2 x 1/9, with 1/2 = 1/3 + 1/6 such that 1/18 = 1/27 + 1/64. The EMLR used this method four times, and the RMP used this method to convert 2/101.
4. Leonardoâs square root method applied the binomial theorem, taken from algebra, and not by geometry as Leonardoâs narrative seems to report. Geometry was also applied in theâ Liber Abaciâ to find roots by double false position method, one of many medieval topics not analyzed in this introductory paper.
