<div id="p1" class="ltx_para">
<br class="ltx_break">
<p class="ltx_p">The Rhind Mathematical Papyrus (RMP), a 1650 BCE hieratic text, began with a 2/n table. The table of unit fraction series included shorthand calculations that took up 1/3 of a papyrus. The RMP also stated and solved 87 problems. The 2/n table contained 51 representations of rational numbers 2/n that were scaled to concise unit fraction series. A trivial 2/3 = 1/3 + 1/3 series and 50 non-trivial series was written down by Ahmes, the RMP scribe. Ahmes converted more difficult rational numbers 2/5 to 2/101 to concise unit fraction series by proto-number theory methods.</p>
</div>
<div id="p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Ahmes scaled 2/n by optimized least common multiples (LCMs) within proto-number theory methods that were often misunderstood by 20th century AD scholars. Aspects of RMP 36 and RMP 37 hekat (volume) problems were also misreported by 20th century scholars. Scholars understated Middle Kingdom proto-number theory in 2/n tables and hekat problems, raw data facts that scribes like Ahmes considered p and q as prime numbers and LCMs as scaling factors.</p>
</div>
<div id="p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Ahmes raw unit fraction data reported in RMP 36 and 37 reported important non-additive patterns. In the 21st century AD three classes of scaled rational number conversion methods have been decoded. Rational numbers n/p were scaled by m/m to mn/mp and inspected the best divisors of mp that summed to mn before writing out concise unit fraction series.</p>
</div>
<div id="p4" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The first 2/n table conversion method scaled rational number 2/n by LCM m to 2m/mn. Ahmes selected ’red auxiliary’ divisors of denominator mn that summed to numerator 2m that allowed concise unit fraction series to be recorded. The first conversion method converted 2/3, 2/5, 2/7, …, 2/101 to concise unit fraction series.</p>
</div>
<div id="p5" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The second conversion method shows that Ahmes could not solve 20/53 by one LCM m. The second rational number conversion method replaced n/p by (n-2)/p + 2/p as demonstrated in RMP 36 and RMP 31.
</p>
</div>
<div id="p6" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In RMP 36 Ahmnes did not solve 30/53 by one LCM m. None could be found. Ahmes solved 28/53 + 2/53 by scaling 28/53 by LCM 2 and 2/53 by LCM 30, two easy to find LCMs.</p>
</div>
<div id="p7" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Note that the second conversion method solved 30/53 and 28/97 by selecting two least common multiples (LCM) m to solve 30/53 = 28/53 + 2/53 and 28/97 = 26/97 + 2/97 by extending the first conversion method. Ahmes converted 26/97 by LCM 4 by considering 104/388 before writing a final unit fraction series. In RMP 31 Ahmes had solved 28/97 by selecting two LCM m scaling factors. Ahmes solved 28/97 that scaled (26/97 + 2/97) that scaled 26/97 by LCM 4 and scaled 2/97 by LCM 56. Note that 2/97 was solved as the 2/n table reported. Hence LCM 56 was a well thought out scaling factor when Ahmes scaled 2/97.</p>

The RMP’s 87 problems reported fragmented initial, intermediate, final, and proof information, the central reason for the scholarly delay.

The corrected RMP translations were posted online in <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">http://ahmespapyrus.blogspot.com/2009/01/ahmes-papyrus-new-and-old.html</span>2009 and 2010.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">In RMP 36 one scribal proof was fairly outlined by Marshall Clagett as an ancient multiplication operation.

A majority of 19th and 20th century Egyptologists identified fragmented duplation details without fairly describing scribal calculations that created concise unit fraction series. Missing from academic discussions were precise meanings of red auxiliary numbers and the context in which scribal calculations took place. The red numbers and economic aspects were implicitly used in 2/n tables and scribal ways that caused scholars to badly guess and muddle the historical record.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">Conclusion: RMP 36 exposed three rational number conversion methods. The first conversion method scaled 2/53 by LCM 30 to 60/1590. A unit fraction series was obtained by red numbers 53 + 4 + 2 + 1 equal to numerator 60. The red numbers were ”best” divisors of denominator 1590. Taken together red number divisors and concise unit fraction series exposed the two of the three 2/n table construction methods. Red number divisors were used to solve an impossible rational number 30/53 by substituting 28/53 + 2/43 Ahmes solved 28/53 by LCM 4 and 2/53 by LCM 30. In RMP 31 Ahmes solved another impossible rational number conversion. Ahmes solved 28/97 by substituting 26/97 scaled by LCM 4 and 2/97 scaled by LCM 56. The n/p = (n -2)/p + 2/p substitution defined Ahmes second conversion method. A third method created virtual n/p tables suggested by identity sums: 2/53 + 3/53 + 5/53 + 15/53 + 28/53 = 53/53, a method that Greeks, Coptics, Arabs and medieval scribes stressed. It is important to note that RMP 36 was written in an economic context. The main purpose of unit fraction arithmetic scaled hekats (of grain) values of beer, bread, and other products for use in wage payments.</p>
