\emph{Ruth Moufang} (1905 - 1977) German mathematician, best known for her work on projective geometry. She was the first woman to teach at the University of Frankfurt, though she didn't start until 1946, having been able to start earlier had it not been for the Nazis. Moufang loops are named after her.
