\begin{document}
\emph{Farkas Bolyai} (1775 - 1856) Hungarian mathematician, father of J\'anos Bolyai. Educated by Calvinists, young Farkas's talent for arithmetic was recognized early on, and soon he was tutoring the children of nobility in mathematics. This opened up and opportunity for him to study mathematics more rigorously in Jena and G\"ottingen. Upon returning to Hungary, Bolyai married Zsuzsanna Benk\"o, who bore him J\'anos. Bolyai spent the rest of his life teaching mathematics to Calvinists in Hungary.
