\emph{Danica Mae McKellar} (1975 - ) American actress, mathematician and author.

As a child, McKellar landed the important r\^ole of Winnie Cooper on the TV show {\it The Wonder Years}. After that, she studied mathematics at UCLA, where she coauthored a paper on the ``Percolation and Gibbs states multiplicity for ferromagnetic Ashkin-Teller models on $\mathbb{Z}^2$'' for the {\it Journal of Physics} with Prof. Lincoln Chayes and a classmate, earning McKellar \PMlinkname{Erd\H{o}s number}{ErdHosNumber} 4 through Chayes. After college, McKellar returned to television with a few recurring r\^oles on shows like {\it The West Wing}. As an actress, she is connected to Kevin Bacon through Marin Hinkle, who was with her in {\it The Year That Trembled} and with Bacon in {\it Rails \& Ties}. She has written two bestselling books, {\it Math Doesn't Suck: How to Survive Middle-School Math without Losing Your Mind or Breaking a Nail} and {\it Kiss My Math: Showing Pre-Algebra Who's Boss}.
