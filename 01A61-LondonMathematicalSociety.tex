The {\em London Mathematical Society} (LMS) is an association of professional mathematicians in the United Kingdom, headquartered in London, England. Established in 1865 in London, the Society was granted royal charter by Queen Elizabeth II at its centennial celebrations. In 1888, Thomas Fiske visited from America, and was inspired to found the New York Mathematical Society (later renamed American Mathematical Society) upon his return.
