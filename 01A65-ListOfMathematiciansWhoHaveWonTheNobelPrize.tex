Although there is no Nobel Prize for mathematics, many mathematicians win the Nobel Prize, often in fields that rely heavily on mathematics, such as physics and economics\footnote{Alfred Nobel's will did not provide for a prize in economics.  What is usually called the Nobel Prize in Economics is technically the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel.}.
