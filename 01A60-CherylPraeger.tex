\emph{Cheryl Elisabeth Praeger} (1948 - ) Australian mathematician, best known for her work in combinatorics.

Born in Toowoomba, Praeger earned her first two degrees at the nearby University of Queensland, then went to England to earn her doctorate from Oxford. She returned to her native country to teach mathematics at the University of Western Australia, where she has been the mentor of about a couple dozen grad students so far. From 1992 to 1994, Praeger was President of the Australian Mathematical Society, and she has also been active in the American Mathematical Society and the London Mathematical Society. In 1999, Queen Elizabeth II bestowed Praeger with the Order of Australia. Since 2005, Praeger has been the Editor-in-Chief of the {\it Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics}.

Praeger has \PMlinkname{Erd\H{o}s number}{ErdHosNumber} 2: With Marcel Herzog she co-authored a paper ``On the fixed points of Sylow subgroups of transitive permutation groups'' in the {\it J. Austral. Math. Soc. Ser. A} {\bf 21}, while Herzog co-authored with  Erd\H{o}s a paper about ``An extremal problem on the set of noncoprime divisors of a number'' in the {\it Israel J. Math.}
