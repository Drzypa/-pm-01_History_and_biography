\emph{Frances Clare Kirwan} (? - ) British mathematician, president of the London Mathematical Society from 2004 to 2006.

Kirwan studied at Cambridge, and went on to graduate work at Oxford, where she now teaches mathematics. In 2005, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council awarded her a Senior Research Fellowship for her work in algebraic geometry. As of 2007, Kirwan has Oxford University Press preprints on Morse stratification, Riemann surfaces and modular cohomology, as well as collaborations on related topics.

Kirwan has \PMlinkname{Erd\H{o}s number}{ErdHosNumber} 3. With David Mumford she published an article on geometric invariant theory in {\it Ergebnisse der Mathematik und ihrer Grenzgebiete}, while Mumford co-authored a paper on planar graphs with Fan Chung Graham.
