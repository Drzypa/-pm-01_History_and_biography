\begin{document}
\emph{Srinivasa Aiyangar Ramanujan} (1887 - 1920) Indian mathematician who made significant contributions to the development of partition functions and summation formulas involving constants such as $\pi$. He is best known for an anecdote of a discussion he had with G. H. Hardy on the dullness of 1729.

Some of his discoveries have been found to have applications in physics, particularly crystallography.
