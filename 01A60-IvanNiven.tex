\begin{document}
{\em Ivan Morton Niven} (25 October 1915 - 9 May 1999) was a Canadian mathematician who helped proved the conjectured answers for Waring's problem. In 1997 he presented a paper on integers that are divisible by their digit sum, but the name given them by Shri Dattathreya Ramachandra Kaprekar, ``Harshad numbers,'' has stuck more than ``Niven numbers.'' Asteroid 12513 bears Niven's name.
