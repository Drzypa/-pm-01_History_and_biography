The {\em Abel Prize} is an annual prize awarded in memory of  Niels Henrik Abel by the Niels Henrik Abel Memorial Fund of Norway to recognize a person's ``outstanding scientific work in the field of mathematics.'' A winner of the prize is called an {\em Abel Laureate}.  A board of five mathematicians is chosen by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters to nominate mathematicians for the prize and make a recommendation to the Academy, which then selects the winner. Besides the prestige, the prize includes a monetary award of 750000 euros.
