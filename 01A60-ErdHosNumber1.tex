A low Erd\H{o}s number is a status symbol among 20th century mathematicians and is similar to the 6-degrees-of-separation concept.

Let $e(p)$ be the Erd\H{o}s number of person $p$.  Your Erd\H{o}s number is 

\begin{itemize}
\item 0 if you are Paul Erd\H{o}s
\item $\min\{e(x) \vert x\in X\} + 1$, where $X$ is the set of all persons you have authored a paper with.
\end{itemize}
