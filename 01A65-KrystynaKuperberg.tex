\emph{Krystyna Kuperberg} n\'ee \emph{Krystina Trybulec} (1944 - ) Polish-born American mathematician best known for providing a counterexample to the Seifert conjecture.

Born of pharmacists in Tarn\'ow, Krystina graduated from a high school in Gda\'nsk and went to the University of Warsaw, majoring in mathematics. She married the mathematician W\l{}odzimierz Kuperberg and took his name. She bore him a son, Greg, who also became a mathematician. The Kuperbergs moved to Sweden in 1969, then to the United States in 1972, where she has given lectures to the American Mathematical Society, the Mathematical Association of America, and the International Congress of Mathematicians.

In 1999, Kuperberg co-authored with Pavel Valtr a paper on ``Almost-tiling the plane by ellipses'' in {\it Discrete Comput. Geom.} {\bf 22}. Valtr had just a few years earlier co-authored with Erd\H{o}s a paper on the Ramsey remainder in {\it European J. Combin.} {\bf 19}.  Thus, Kuperberg's \PMlinkname{Erd\H{o}s number}{ErdHosNumber} is 2.
