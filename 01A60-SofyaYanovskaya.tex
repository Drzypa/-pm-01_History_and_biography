\begin{document}
\emph{Sofya Aleksandrovna Yanovskaya} (sometimes transliterated \emph{Sof'ja Aleksandrovna Janovskaja}) (1896 -- 1966) Soviet Jewish mathematician, educator, perhaps best known for translating Karl Marx's mathematical works to Russian.

Born in what was at the time Poland, her family moved to Odessa, where she studied mathematics. Yanovskaya's schooling was interrupted by the uprising of 1917, and she helped as a nurse for political prisoners. By 1924 she was able to resume her studies in Moscow, and in 1931 she began teaching there. During World War II, she was evacuated to the Ural mountains, but afterwards resumed teaching in Moscow. In 1951, she was awarded the \PMlinkescapetext{Order} of Lenin.
