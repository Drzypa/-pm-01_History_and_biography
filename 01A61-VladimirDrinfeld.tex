\begin{document}
\emph{Vladimir Gershonovich Drinfel'd} (born 1954) Ukrainian mathematician and mathematical physicist. Proposing the term \PMlinkname{``quantum group''}{QuantumGroups} Drinfel'd indicated the connection between quasi-triangular Hopf algebras and solutions of the quantum Yang-Baxter equations involving the R-matrix. Subsequently, quantum groups have become a field of thorough mathematical investigation
and the construction of finite quantum groups from Hopf algebras or, more recently, from Hopf C*-algebras
has been carried out in detail {\em via} Fourier transformation as such finite groups are dual to certain 
\PMlinkname{Hopf C*-algebras}{QuantumGroups}. he also introduced the contruction of the quantum double leading later
to quantum supergroups and quantized enveloping superalgebras. 
\PMlinkname{Drinfel'd modules and Drinfel'd twists}{QuantumDouble} are named after him. He was awarded and accepted the Fields medal in 1990.
