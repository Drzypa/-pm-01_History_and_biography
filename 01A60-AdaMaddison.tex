\emph{Ada Isabel Maddison} (1869 - 1950) British mathematician best known for her work on differential equations.

Although Maddison passed an honors exam for Oxford, she was not given a degree there. Instead, she went to Bryn Mawr in Pennsylvania. In 1893, the University of London gave her a bachelor's degree in mathematics with honors. After further study at G\"ottingen, Maddison went back to Bryn Mawr, where she taught as well as did administrative work. The administrative work, however, consumed  much time she would have rather spent on mathematical research. Though her will did endow a pension fund for Bryn Mawr's administrative staff. She also put together a thorough listing of university courses open to women at the time in British and Canadian universities.
