\emph{Ernst Gabor Straus} (1922 - 1983) German-American Jewish mathematician and physicist, best known in mathematics for his work on Ramsey theory.

Born in Munich of a lawyer and a doctor, young Ernst showed an ability for mathematics from early on. But with Hitler's rise to power in Germany in the 1930s and the death of the Straus paterfamilias, the surviving Strauses fled to Israel and later the United States, where he co-authored papers with Albert Einstein and Paul Erd\H{o}s. Straus stayed in America for the rest of his life.
