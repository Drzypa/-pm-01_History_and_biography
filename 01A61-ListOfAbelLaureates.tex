\begin{document}
2003: Jean-Pierre Serre, ``for playing a key role in shaping the modern form of many parts of mathematics, including topology, algebraic geometry and number theory.''

2004: Sir Michael Francis Atiyah and Isadore M. Singer, ``for their discovery and proof of the index theorem, bringing together topology, geometry and analysis, and their outstanding role in building new bridges between mathematics and theoretical physics.''

2005: Peter D. Lax, ``for his groundbreaking contributions to the theory and application of partial differential equations and to the computation of their solutions.''

2006: Lennart Carleson, ``for his profound and seminal contributions to harmonic analysis and the theory of smooth dynamical systems.''

2007: Srinivasa S. R. Varadhan, ``for his fundamental contributions to probability theory and in particular for creating a unified theory of large deviations.''

2008: Jacques Tits and John Griggs Thompson ``for their profound achievements in algebra and in particular for shaping modern group theory.''

2009: Mikhail Leonidovich Gromov, ``for his revolutionary contributions to geometry.''
