\emph{Michael Byster}, often referred to as \emph{Mike Byster}, (? - ) American stockbroker, arithmetician and math educator.

Byster used to work at the mercantile exchange, but after his cousin, a math teacher in a Chicago elementary school, invited him to show the class his shortcuts for doing base 10 arithmetic, Byster quit his job and income to devote himself to teaching children his methods. Byster married Robin and they have a son, Joshua, to whom he has taught his methods.

On the {\it 20/20} newsmagazine show on ABC, Byster demonstrated some of his shortcuts for doing arithmetic without the aid of a calculator or even pencil and paper.
