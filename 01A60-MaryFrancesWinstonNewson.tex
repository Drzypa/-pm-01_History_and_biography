\emph{Mary Frances Winston Newson} n\'ee \emph{Mary Frances Winston} (1869 - 1935) American mathematician, best known for her work on differential equations. She also translated one of David Hilbert's lectures.

Born in Illinois, Newson studied at the University of Wisconsin and later at Bryn Mawr College and the University of Chicago. With help from Christine Ladd-Franklin, Newson went to study at G\"ottingen. After that she was the entire mathematics faculty of the Kansas State Agricultural College and joined the American Mathematical Society. She married Henry Byron Newson and they had three children. When her husband died in 1910, she found herself in the difficult position of having to apply for work as a single woman with children.
