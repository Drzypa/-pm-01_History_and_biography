Neil James Alexander Sloane is an American mathematician best known for the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences.

Sloane received his \PMlinkescapetext{Ph.D.} in 1967 from Cornell University, for his dissertation on lengths of cycle times in random neural networks. Sloane did significant work for AT \& T Bell Labs on error-correcting codes.

Sloane coauthored  \PMlinkescapetext{\emph{Sphere Packings, Lattices and Groups}} with John Horton Conway, giving him an \PMlinkname{Erd\H{o}s number}{ErdHosNumber}
