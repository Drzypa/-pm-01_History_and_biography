The {\em Erd\H{o}s-Bacon number} of a mathematician or an actor is the sum of their \PMlinkname{Erd\H{o}s number}{ErdHosNumber} and their Bacon number. Not many professional mathematicians have had film r\^oles. However, a few important ones have done consulting work for Hollywood films about mathematicians, such as {\it A Beautiful Mind}. For example, William Timothy Gowers, who has Erd\H{o}s number 4, was a consultant for {\it Proof}, with Gwyneth Paltrow in the lead r\^ole. Paltrow was in {\it se7en} with Endre Hules, who was in {\it Apollo 13} with Kevin Bacon. Thus Gowers has an Erd\H{o}s-Bacon number of 7. Daniel Kleitman, consultant for {\it Good Will Hunting}, has an even smaller Erd\H{o}s-Bacon number, 3, since he co-authored a paper with Erd\H{o}s and the film included Minnie Driver, who starred with Bacon in {\it Sleepers}. The smallest likely Erd\H{o}s-Bacon number would probably be 2, if an Erd\H{o}s co-author consulted for a movie starring Bacon. It's also possible that Kevin Bacon could co-author a mathematical paper with an Erd\H{o}s co-author, but this appears unlikely.
