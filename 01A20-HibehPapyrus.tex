\begin{document}
The \PMlinkexternal{Hibeh Papyrus}{http://mathforum.org/kb/plaintext.jspa?messageID=5539288} was written between 300 BCE to 270 BCE by a Greek scribe that lived in Hellenized Egypt. The numerical Greek data was transliterated by David Fowler and Eric Turner in Historia Mathematics, 10 (1983), 344-358. Units of Greek days were recorded in 1/45 parts unit fraction arithmetic. 

An implicit n/45 table was re-constructed by Fowler and other scholars created a 90 percent accurate translation. To decode an additional 5 percent of the text Greek denominators Greek letters  alpha = 1, beta = 2 and so forth denominators must be understood with letters followed by ('). The (') symbol denoted unit fractions, i.e. 1/2 = beta'. That is, unit fraction denominators n recorded 1/n as n' in ciphered Greek letters. 

One of the n/45 table entries 13/45 recorded delta' lambda' rho-pi'

13/45 data that is translated to a concise unit fraction series 

1/4 1/30 (1/(80 +100) 

meant

13/45 = 1/4 + 1/30 + 1/180

The scribal narrative offered alternate series for several n/45 table entries. The scribe  referenced the unit fraction encoding method commonly used in the 300 BCE period. The text mapped numerals onto Greek alpha, beta, gamma method that was adopted from a closely related Egyptian Middle Kingdom system (2050 BCE to 1550 BCE).

Note that  LCM 4 scaled 13/45 to 52/180 such that: 

52/180 = (45 + 6 + 1)/180 = 1/4 + 1/30 + 1/180

In total the 44 n/45 table entries three LCMs 1, 2 and 4 encoded the entire text making the text the simplest unit fraction series reported in any Greek or Egyptian math text.

Additional scribal n/45 scaled facts added back complete arithmetic sentences. In summary, the implicit n/45 table explicitly cited 31 members. There were 13 missing members: 5/45, 6/45, 12/45, 15/45, 18/45, 20/45, 27/45, 30/45, 31/45, 33/45 35/45, 39/45 and 40/45. 

Added back scaled scribal intermediate calculations of each n/45 conversion agrees with Fowler's 1983 analysis. Only least common multiple LCM m goes beyond Fowler's analysis. The complete n/45 tables assists the reader to understand 27 length of day and night of festival date as vivid calendar fact markers by first grasping the n/45 table:

LCM 2 meant the divisors of 90: 45, 30, 18, 15, 10, 9, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 were summed to 31 n/45 numerator as intermediate steps, and other n/45 conversions as unit fraction series alternatives.

LCM 4 meant the divisors of 180: 90, 60, 30, 20, 18, 15, 12, 10, 9, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 appeared in five numerators 13/45, 14/45, 42/45, 43/45, and 44/45, and other n/45 conversions as unit fraction series alternatives.

One purpose of the papyrus listed 27 Greek festivals recorded within an Egyptian civil calendar verified by length of day and night recorded in exact unit fraction series: \PMlinkexternal{local month names}{http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Measurements2.htm} and \PMlinkexternal{classical Greek local calendars}{http://www.mlahanas.de/Egypt/EgyptianCalendar.html}. Ciphered Greek unit fraction series considered an analysis provided by David Fowler and Eric Turner: Hibeh Papyrus Historia Mathematics, 10 (1983), 344-359 and other analysis reported by Bruce Friedman. The LCM method was consistent with Egyptian MK texts, two of which are linked \PMlinkexternal{references}{http://rmprectotable.blogspot.com/}. \PMlinkexternal{The entire Hibeh Papyrus included a wide range of subjects}{http://www.archive.org/stream/hibehpapyri01egypuoft/hibehpapyri01egypuoft_djvu.txt}.

David Fowler mentioned the 1202 AD Liber Abaci (written by Fibonacci) used unit fraction arithmetic without mentioning that a major Arab algorithm change took place after 800 AD. Prior to 800 AD the Akhmim Papyrus, Hibeh Papyrus, and the RMP used non-algorithm LCM m methods. Scribes encoded 4/13 by LCM 4 to 16/52 =(13 + 2+ 1)/52 = 1/4 + 1/26 + 1/52 (in the RMP and Akhmim Papyrus). Fibonacci applied an algorithm and LCM 4 to 4/13. Fibonacci subtracted 1/4 from 4/13, obtained 3/52, subtracted 1/18 from 3/52, and obtained 4/13 = 1/4 + 1/18 + 1/468. 

Summary: LCM 1, 2 and 4 scaled 27 festival dates and day and night lengths to trivial and non-trivial unit fraction series. The HP LCM scaling method followed a 1,500 year older Egyptian Middle Kingdom tradition. The Egyptian-Greek LCM unit fraction conversion method was continuously used for 2,800 years until \PMlinkexternal{800 AD}{http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=7485114&tstart=0}, when an Arab algorithm formally changed rational number conversions to a subtraction context (n/p - 1/m = (mn - p)/mp).
