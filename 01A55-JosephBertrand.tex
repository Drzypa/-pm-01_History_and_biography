\begin{document}
\emph{Joseph Louis-Fran\c{c}ois Bertrand} (1822 - 1900) French mathematician, economist and translator who translated Carl Friedrich Gauss's books to French. Bertrand is perhaps best known for Bertrand's conjecture regarding the distribution of prime numbers between a given integer and its double.

In 1884 he took over seat 40 of the Academie Fran\c{c}aise for Jean-Baptiste Dumas. Upon his death, Bertrand's seat was given to Marcellin Berthelot.
