\begin{document}
The \emph{Marquise du Ch\^atelet}, n\'ee \emph{Gabrielle-\'Emilie le Tonnelier de Breteuil} (1706 - 1749) French mathematician and physicist. The daughter of an important functionary in King Louis XIV's court, she was well-educated in languages, sciences, mathematics, arts and sports. Barely 20, she married the Marquis du Ch\^atelet and bore him three children, possibly by other men. To educate her children, she wrote a textbook on physics and made a French translation of Isaac Newton's {\it Philosophie naturalis principia mathematica} that is still used today. Her approximation $e \sim mv^2$ (the energy $e$ of a moving object is proportional to its mass $m$ times the square of its velocity $v$) presaged Einstein's equation $e = mc^2$ by a century and a half.
