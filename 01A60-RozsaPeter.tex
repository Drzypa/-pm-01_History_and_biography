\emph{R\'ozsa P\'eter} n\'ee \emph{R\'osza Politzer} (1905 - 1977) Hungarian mathematician and textbook author, best known for her work on recursive functions.

Born in Budapest of a lawyer and a housewife, young R\'osza's education began  at the public schools in her native city. Because of her father's wishes, she enrolled in the E\"otv\"os Lor\'and University to major in chemistry. However, she realized that she preferred pure mathematics and changed her major. In 1935 she earned a doctorate and \emph{summa cum laude} honors. After graduation, she had various jobs tutoring in mathematics. It wasn't until 1955 that she began teaching at her alma mater.
