The {\em National Science Foundation} (NSF for short) is an agency of the United States government which primarily promotes research in engineering and computer science (playing a pivotal r\^ole in the development of the Internet, for example), but also gives grants to professional mathematicians for research in pure and applied mathematics. The involvement of the NSF in mathematics educations has had its share of controversy, however.
